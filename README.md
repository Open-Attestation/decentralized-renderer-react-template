# decentralized-renderer-react-template

React boilerplate to write decentralize renderer.

## Install

The easiest way to use **decentralized-renderer-react-template** is through github by clicking on `Use this template` button in the repository page.

You can also download or `git clone` this repo

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Open-Attestation/decentralized-renderer-react-template.git my-module
$ cd my-module
$ rm -rf .git
$ npm install
```

Make sure to edit the following files according to your module's info:

- package.json (module name and version)
- README.md
- LICENSE
- add your own template (in `src/templates` folder) and configure correctly the template registry (in `src/templates/index.tsx` file)

## Testing the templates in an integrated environment

This template provides a simple application that is able to render documents built for the current renderer. To use it:
1. Open `integration/index.tsx` file and edit the `documents` property of the `App` component to suit your needs (provide any document that is available locally, whether it's a javascript, JSON or typescript document).
1. Start your renderer: `npm run dev`
1. Start the local application: `npm run example:application`
1. Head to `http://localhost:3010/`, you should see the configured component during step 1. 

## Commands

```sh
$ npm run storybook # open storybook and start editing your components
$ npm run storybook:build # generate docs
$ npm run test:watch # run tests with Jest
$ npm run test:coverage # run tests with coverage
$ npm run lint # lint code
$ npm run build # build component
```

## Setting up CI with automatic semantic-release versioning

Generate CircleCI API token and run:

```sh
$ npx semantic-release-cli setup --ask-for-passwords`
```

You will need to provide credentials for github and npm.

## Code organization and development

- `index.ts` contains the logic to communicate with the host embedding your renderer. You probably will _never_ need to update that file.
- template registry configuration is located in `src/templates/index.tsx`
- templates are located in `src/templates` folder. You can add as many template as you want and structure the code the way you want
- documents samples contains fake data to test the templates you build. You can create a typescript interface to make sure that your template uses the correct expected document
  - create a type describing the kind of document you expect to render (for instance check `CustomTemplateCertificate` in `src/sample.tsx`)
  - create a template consuming that interface, using the `TemplateProps` helper from `@govtechsg/decentralized-renderer-react-components (for instance check the template in`src/templates/customTemplate/customTemplate.tsx`)
- shared components are located in `src/core` folder. For instance you can find a watermark example that will be displayed when printing the document
- feel free to remove whatever you dont need
